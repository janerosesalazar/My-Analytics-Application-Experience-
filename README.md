## 3.1. Challenges I Experienced in EDA, Inferential Regression Analysis, and Regression for Machine Learning

Throughout the midterm tasks, I faced several challenges while working on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, **Inferential Regression**, and **Machine Learning Regression**.

### 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

During EDA, I struggled with fully understanding the dataset because of several issues:

- Handling **missing values**, **inconsistent formatting**, and **outliers**, which affected the accuracy of my insights.
- Difficulty interpreting visualizations when **multiple variables interacted** with each other.
- Uncertainty about which plots were most appropriate for showing relationships and trends.

These made it harder for me to clearly see the story behind the data.

### 📉 Inferential Regression Analysis

In Inferential Regression, I encountered more conceptual challenges:

- Understanding **regression coefficients**, **p-values**, and **confidence intervals** was not straightforward at first.
- I found it difficult to remember and check the **assumptions of regression**, such as linearity, normality, and homoscedasticity.
- Translating the statistical outputs into **meaningful, real-world conclusions** was especially challenging.

I realized that knowing how to run a regression is different from being able to clearly explain what the results actually mean.

### 🤖 Regression for Machine Learning

When I moved to Machine Learning Regression, the challenges became more technical:

- Difficulty in **selecting appropriate features** and preparing the data correctly (encoding, scaling, splitting).
- Struggles with **interpreting performance metrics** like MAE, RMSE, and R².
- Concerns about **overfitting** and understanding why one model performed better than another.
- Confusion about how to connect the model results back to the **business problem** or real-life decision-making.

All of these made the machine learning part feel both interesting and overwhelming at the same time.

## 3.2. Why Did These Challenges Happen? What Did I Learn?

These challenges happened mainly because many of the concepts, tools, and techniques were still **new to me**.

### 🧠 Reasons Behind the Challenges

- **Real-world data is rarely clean**, so encountering missing values, noise, and outliers made the analysis more complicated than I initially expected.
- I was still learning how to use multiple tools simultaneously, such as **Jupyter Notebook**, **pandas**, **scikit-learn**, and various **visualization libraries**.
- There was a clear **gap between theory and practice**—understanding a concept in class is very different from applying it to an actual dataset.
- I also realized that interpreting results from a **business perspective** requires a different mindset than simply producing numbers and graphs.

All of this contributed to why some steps felt slower, more confusing, or more difficult.

### 🎓 Lessons That Will Help Me Improve

From these experiences, I learned several important things that will guide how I work in the future:

- The importance of **thorough data cleaning** before moving to analysis or modeling.
- The need to **check statistical assumptions** to ensure that my interpretations are valid.
- The value of **documenting each step clearly** in my notebook so that the process is transparent and reproducible.
- The importance of always connecting **technical findings to real-world implications**, especially from a **business and decision-making perspective**.
- Following a structured approach like **CRISP-DM** (Business Understanding → Data Understanding → Data Preparation → Modeling → Evaluation → Deployment) makes the process clearer and more logical.

These lessons are already helping me approach analytics tasks more carefully and confidently.

## 3.3. What I Need to Do Better Next Time

Next time, I want to apply what I’ve learned so I can work more efficiently and produce more meaningful insights.

### 📈 Areas I Want to Improve

- **Spend more time on data quality** before modeling:
  - Check for missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
  - Identify and handle outliers early in the process.
- **Practice interpreting correlations and regression outputs** in simpler, more intuitive terms:
  - Explain whether relationships are strong/weak, positive/negative.
  - Describe what happens to the target variable when a predictor changes.
- **Follow the CRISP-DM framework more consistently**:
  - Start with clear **Business Understanding** so that every step is aligned with the problem.
  - Make sure that **Evaluation** includes both technical performance and business interpretation.
- **Strengthen my understanding of model assumptions and metrics**:
  - Learn when to use certain models and how to evaluate them properly.
  - Be more comfortable explaining MAE, RMSE, R², and other metrics.
- **Improve how I communicate insights**:
  - Focus more on the **business implications** of the results.
  - Answer questions like “So what?” and “What should we do next?” in my conclusions.

By applying these improvements, I believe I can produce more accurate analyses and more **professional, insightful work** that is aligned with the expectations for **analytics and business analyst roles**.
