Once the data is loaded into a DataFrame, we’ll explore simple techniques to identify missing values. This includes checking for NaN entries, summarizing null counts per column, and using visual or logical methods to detect incomplete rows. Spotting missing data early is an important step in ensuring data quality before analysis or modeling."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":34,"id":"41e2eb4f-9c12-4f4d-9e60-dd84bb36abbe","metadata":{"id":"41e2eb4f-9c12-4f4d-9e60-dd84bb36abbe","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1757033929259,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":37,"user":{"displayName":"janerose salazar","userId":"12774283321753314946"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["# Import the necessary libraries\n","import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np\n","import os"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"ZLgHjtr_PeVC"},"id":"ZLgHjtr_PeVC"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":35,"id":"e4bb1866-1621-4b29-b458-2af88c737f17","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"e4bb1866-1621-4b29-b458-2af88c737f17","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1757033929277,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":15,"user":{"displayName":"janerose salazar","userId":"12774283321753314946"}},"outputId":"61003f06-80a0-4e7b-ecae-5f05795341a8"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["/content\n"]}],"source":["#Checking out the current working directory\n","print(os.getcwd())"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"oAFN0Od8RN7l","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1757033929307,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":29,"user":{"displayName":"janerose salazar","userId":"12774283321753314946"}}},"id":"oAFN0Od8RN7l","execution_count":35,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":36,"id":"7ce8fb23-5d11-487e-9a08-15b9fb361548","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":443},"id":"7ce8fb23-5d11-487e-9a08-15b9fb361548","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1757033929589,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":292,"user":{"displayName":"janerose salazar","userId":"12774283321753314946"}},"outputId":"21545f68-b915-4fd1-afa8-6e292be9439f"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["        Sex  Item1  Item2  Item3  Item4  Item5  Item6  Item7  Item8  Item9  \\\n","0    Female    1.0    2.0    1.0    5.0    2.0    3.0    1.0    5.0    4.0   \n","1    Female    5.0    5.0    1.0    4.0    5.0    4.0    5.0    5.0    5.0   \n","2      Male    2.0    5.0    1.0    3.0    3.0    2.0    5.0    1.0    5.0   \n","3      Male    2.0    4.0    1.0    5.0    2.0    3.0    2.0    2.0    2.0   \n","4       NaN    NaN    NaN    NaN    NaN    4.0    2.0    5.0    4.0    1.0   \n","..      ...    ...    ...    ...    ...    ...    ...    ...    ...    ...   \n","454    Male    1.0    4.0    3.0    5.0    2.0    4.0    5.0    2.0    2.0   \n","455  Female    1.0    4.0    1.0    3.0    3.0    3.0    2.0    5.0    4.0   \n","456    Male    2.0    5.0    1.0    5.0    1.0    4.0    5.0    5.0    5.0   \n","457    Male    4.0    4.0    4.0    5.0    2.0    2.0    2.0    2.0    4.0   \n","458    Male    1.0    5.0    2.0    5.0    2.0    5.0    2.0    2.0    4.0   \n","\n","     ...
